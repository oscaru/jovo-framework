## Introduction

![jovo convert command](../img/jovo-deploy.png "jovo convert command")


`jovo convert` is the Jovo CLI command to either convert i18n.json-files to .csv-files, or .csv-files to i18n.json.files. This way you can import your i18n-model to a cms of your choice, or convert your cms data to respective local i18n files.

## Workflow

The `jovo convert` command is followed by the function type you want to run depending on your use case. You have to set the path of your originating files with the `--from <originPath>` option. You can choose between setting an entire folder (for `jovo convert i18nToCsv`) or just a single file (for `jovo convert csvToI18n` and `jovo convert i18nToCsv`).

```sh
# Default
$ jovo convert i18nToCsv|csvToI18n --from <originPath>

# Options
$ jovo convert i18nToCsv|csvToI18n --from <originPath> [--to <targetPath>] 
```

The respective output files will be created either in your directory of choice, which you can optionally set with `--to <targetPath>` or in your root project folder, either in a `i18n/` folder or as a `responses.csv` file.
