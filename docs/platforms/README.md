## Introduction to Platform Specific Features

To learn more about how to make most out of the platform-specific features, it's helpful to understand how the Jovo cross-platform architecture works.

![Jovo Platform Specific Tell Response](../img/platform-specific-tell.png)

The Jovo app object (`this` inside `app.js`) figures out which platform the user is conversing with, and then uses this information to either call the functions of the `alexaSkill` or `googleAction` object.

As Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant both have platform specific features, you can access them directly by calling the `alexaSkill` or `googleAction` objects. By using those classes, keep in mind that, in the end, there needs to be a function call where an emit happens for the platforms you're using. For example, in the [tell](../04_app-logic/03_output#tell './output#tell'), [ask](../04_app-logic/03_output#ask './output#ask'), [endSession](../04_app-logic/03_output#no-speech-output './output#no-speech-output'), and raw [JSON response calls](../04_app-logic/03_output#raw-json-responses './output#raw-json-responses').

These emit methods can also be accessed directly with the platform specific objects, so you don't have to use `this.tell` when developing only for one platform:

```javascript
// Example
let alexa = this.$alexaSkill;
alexa.tell('Hello World!');
```

### Get Platform Type

Want to see which platform your user is currently interacting with? With `getType`, you can get exactly this.

```javascript
this.getType();
```

This is going to return a type that looks like this:

```javascript
// For Amazon Alexa
AlexaSkill

// For Google Assistant
GoogleAction
```

You can also use the following method calls:

```javascript
// Returns true for Alexa Skills
this.isAlexaSkill()

// Returns true for Google Actions
this.isGoogleAction()
```
