## Introduction to Voice Interactions

The request and response lifecycle of a voice application has two key concepts:
* Session
* Interaction

Each interaction between a user and a voice application consists of an interaction pair with a `request` and a `response`.

### Request

The `request` is the incoming data that the voice platform sends to your app's endpoint. It consists of information like:

* User ID,
* [Intent](./routing/intents.md './routing/intents'), e.g. `MyNameIsIntent`
* [Input](./routing/input.md './routing/input'), e.g. `name`
* Session [data](./data, './data'), e.g. a [state](./routing/states.md './routing/states')

and other things that might be relevant to your app. You can access the incoming request with `this.$request`.

### Logic

The app logic is what happens between an incoming request and sending back a response to the voice platform.

Usually, this includes:
* [Routing](./routing './routing') through intents, states, and variable user input
* [Data](./data, './data') input and storage
* Other things like business logic and API calls

### Response

The `response` is what you send back to the platform after the `request` has been run through your app logic. It includes

* Speech output (text or audio URL)
* Visual output to display on screens
* Session data

> [Find more information on Output here](./ouput './output').

You can access the incoming request with `this.$response`.

## Sessions

A `session` is an uninterrupted interaction between a user and your application. It consists of at least one `request` and `response` interaction pair, but can have a series of inputs and outputs. A session can end for the following reasons:

* The response includes `shouldEndSession`, which is true for `tell` and `endSession` method calls
* A user doesn't respond to an ask prompt and the session times out
* The user asks to end the session by saying "quit" or "exit"
