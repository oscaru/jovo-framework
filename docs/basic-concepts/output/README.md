## Introduction to Output Types

What do users expect from a voice assistant? Usually, it's either direct or indirect output in form of speech, audio, or visual information. In this section, you will learn more about basic output types like [`tell`](#tell), [`ask`](#ask), but also how to use SSML or the Jovo [speechBuilder](#speechbuilder) to create more advanced output elements.


## Basic Output

Jovo's basic output options offer simple methods for interacting with users through text-to-speech. If you're interested in more, take a look at [Advanced Output](#advanced-output).

### tell

The tell method is used to have Alexa or Google Assistant say something to your users. You can either use plain text, [SSML](#ssml) (Speech Synthesis Markup Language), or a [speechBuilder](#speechbuilder) object (`this.$speech`)).

```javascript
this.tell(speech);

// Use plain text as speech output
this.tell('Hello World!');

// Use SSML as speech output
this.tell('<speak>Hello <say-as interpret-as="spell-out">World</say-as></speak>');
```

Important: The session ends after a `tell` method, this means the mic is off and there is no more interaction between the user and your app until the user invokes it again. 

> [Learn more about sessions here](../requests-responses  './requests-responses').

### ask

Whenever you want to make the experience more interactive and get some user input, the `ask` method is the way to go.

This method keeps the mic open, meaning the speech element is used initially to ask the user for some input. If there is no response, the reprompt is used to ask again.

```javascript
this.ask(speech, reprompt);

this.ask('How old are you?', 'Please tell me your age');
```

You can also use [SSML](#ssml) or [speechBuilder](#speechbuilder) objects (`this.$speech` and `this.$reprompt`) for your speech and reprompt elements.

#### Multiple Reprompts

Google Assistant offers the functionality to use multiple reprompts.

```javascript
this.ask(speech, reprompt1, reprompt2, goodbyeMessage);
```

> You can find more detail about this feature here: [Platforms > Google Assistant > Multiple Reprompts](../../platforms/google-assistant/README.md#multiple-reprompts './google-assistant#multiple-reprompts').

### repeat

It is recommended to use a `RepeatIntent` (e.g. the `AMAZON.RepeatIntent`) that allows users to ask your app to repeat the previous output if they missed it.

```javascript
this.repeat();

// Example
RepeatIntent() {
    this.repeat();
}
```

> This feature makes use of the [Jovo User Context](../data/user.md#context './data/user#context'). To be able to use it, please make sure that you have a database integration set up and the Jovo User Context enabled.


## Advanced Output

Voice platforms offer a lot more than just converting a sentence or paragraph to speech output. In the following sections, you will learn more about advanced output elements.

### SSML

SSML is short for "Speech Synthesis Markup Language." You can use it to add more things like pronunciations, breaks, or audio files. For some more info, see the SSML references [by Amazon](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/speech-synthesis-markup-language-ssml-reference), and [by Google](https://developers.google.com/actions/reference/ssml). Here's another valuable resource for [cross-platform SSML](http://ssml.green/).

Here is an example how SSML-enriched output could look like:

```javascript
let speech = '<speak>Welcome to this Pizza Skill.'
      + 'Don\'t we all want some <say-as interpret-as="spell-out">pizza</say-as>'
      + 'in our life? <break time="1s"/> Oh yes.'
      + '<audio src="https://www.jovo.tech/downloads/pizza.mp3"/></speak>';

this.tell(speech);
```

But isn't that a little inconvenient? Let's take a look at the Jovo [speechBuilder](#speechbuilder).

### speechBuilder

With the `speechBuilder`, you can assemble a speech element by adding different types of input:

```javascript
this.$speech.addText('Welcome to this Pizza Skill.')
        .addBreak('300ms')
        .addAudio('https://www.jovo.tech/downloads/pizza.mp3');

this.tell(this.$speech);
```

> [You can find everything about the SpeechBuilder here](./speechbuilder.md  './output/speechbuilder').

### i18n

Jovo uses a package called [i18next](https://www.npmjs.com/package/i18next) to support multilanguage voice apps.

```javascript
let speech = this.t('WELCOME');
```

> [Learn more about i18n responses here](./i18n.md  './output/i18n'). 


### Raw JSON Responses
If you prefer to return some specific responses in a raw JSON format, you can do this with the platform-specific functions `this.<platform-name>.setResponseObject(obj)`.

```javascript
// Set a Raw JSON Response for Alexa
this.$alexaSkill.setResponseObject(obj);

// Set a Raw JSON Response for Google Assistant
this.$googleAction.setResponseObject(obj);

// Set a Raw JSON Response for Twilio Autopilot
this.$autopilotBot.setResponseObject(obj);

// ... all the other platforms
```

## Visual Output

The Jovo framework, besides sound and voice output, can also be used for visual output.

> [Learn more about visual output here](./visual-output.md './output/visual-output'). 


## No Speech Output

Sometimes, you might want to end a session without speech output. In that case, simply don't add any kind of output in your handler function.
