## Introduction

The Jovo Framework has a flexible and extensible architecture that is split into different modules.

With every [request and response](../basic-concepts/requests-responses './requests-responses') interaction pair, the framework runs through the following process:

Middleware | Description
--- | --- 
`setup` | First initialization of `app` object with first incoming request. Is executed once as long as `app` is alive
`request` | Raw JSON request from platform gets processed. Can be used for authentication middlewares.
`platform.init` | Determines which platform (e.g. `Alexa`, `GoogleAssistant`) sent the request. Initialization of abstracted `jovo` (`this`) object.
`platform.nlu` | Natural language understanding (NLU) information gets extracted for built-in NLUs (e.g. `Alexa`). Intents and inputs are set.
`nlu` | Request gets routed through external NLU (e.g. `Dialogflow` standalone). Intents and inputs are set.
`user.load` | Initialization of user object. User data is retrieved from database.
`router` | Request and NLU data (intent, input, state) is passed to router. intentMap and inputMap are executed. Handler path is generated. 
`handler` | Handler logic is executed. Output object is created and finalized.
`user.save` | User gets finalized, DB operations.
`platform.output` | Platform response JSON gets created from output object.
`response` | Response gets sent back to platform.
`fail` | Errors get handled if applicable.


## Packages

### jovo-core

The `jovo-core` package contains the interfaces of all of the main concepts of Jovo: `BaseApp`, `Conversation`, `Jovo`, `Middleware`, `SpeechBuilder`, `TestSuite`, and `User`.


### jovo-framework

The `jovo-framework` package is the main implementation of the Jovo Framework, and the probably most visible module for users. It contains all the relevant implementations for building an app with Jovo, like `App`, `Handler`, `Router`, `JovoUser`, as well as logging, hosting, and integration capabilities.


### jovo-integrations

The `jovo-integrations` packages offer several implementations of voice platforms, plugins, and other integrations like databases or analytics.

#### Platforms

Platforms like Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant have the prefix `jovo-platform-`, and currently include:

* `jovo-platform-alexa`
* `jovo-platform-googleassistant`
* `jovo-platform-dialogflow`

#### Databases

Database integrations like DynamoDB or MySQL have the prefix `jovo-db-`, and currently include:

* `jovo-db-filedb`
* `jovo-db-dynamodb`
* `jovo-db-mysql`

#### Analytics

Analytics integrations like Dashbot or Botanalytics have the prefix `jovo-analytics-`, and currently include:

* `jovo-analytics-dashbot`


#### Plugins

General plugins have the prefix `jovo-plugin-`, and currently include:

* `jovo-plugin-debugger`
* `jovo-plugin-lmtester`
